# Introduction

## Welcome to DLabs Frontend Team!  
<!-- Greetings -->
<!-- What to expect from this documentation -->
In this page, I hope that you can understand **what we are**, **what we do**, and **what to do** so you know your surroundings and understand how are things organised.
This documentation purpose is to document projects of DDI (as parent company).

As a member of DLabs, you have to know that we're all in one team, but focuses in a lot of different project from DDI (short for Daya Dimensi Indonesia). DDI itself have a lot of children company like Klob for example, and underneath the children company there can be multiple projects inside of it.

## Introduction
### First Thing First: What's DLabs?
At first there is no such things as "DLabs", until somewhere in 2021. After a while DDI's project grows and we need a better infrastructure that allow us to work together as a team despite the position of developers in the company. At the time, developers exclusively work only in their project and can't join other project because of our organisation structure doesn't allow it. Now with DLabs existence, we are together with developers coming from different projects such as Assessment Hub, Odyssey, Klob, Dyalog and more.

### The Goal of Frontend DLabs Doc
Despite the long DLabs existence we are having a hard time to move from one project to another project because of lack communication and possibly documentation. *And thus,* the goal of this project is **to gather information about each project and document it so every developer can join and leave project effortlessly**.
